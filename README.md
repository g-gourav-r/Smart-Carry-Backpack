### Connections 
#### FSR and Force Sensor
- One of the lead of the FSR is connected to the 5V pin in Arduino.
- The other lead of the FSR is connected to the 22K resistor and the resistor is connected to the GND pin of the arduino.
- The lead is also connected to the A0, A1, A2 pins of the arduino ( A0 -> Middle sensor, A1 and A2 pins are from the strap ).
#### Buzzer
- The positive lead of the buzzer is connected to pin number 7.
- The negative lead is connected to the gnd pin of the arduino.
#### Bluetooth (HC-05)
- RX pin is connected to TX pin of arduino. 
- TX pin is connected to RX pin of arduino. 
- VCC pin is connected to the 5V terminal of the arduino.
- gnd is connected to the gnd of arduino.

### Android App

While installing the application, your android smart phone can prevent it from downloading as it's an unauthorised source. Click on **Install Anyway** to install the application.

- Click on connect to bluetooth button and select your device. ( Before opening the app, make sure you have connected to the bluetooth module, It's usually named **HC-05** and it's password will be **1234**.
- Click on "*Find My Bag"* to check if your bag is connected. You'll hear a beep if the bag is connected.
- Click on "*Callibrate*" to check which strap has to be adjusted properly.

##### **NOTE**
If you are getting the output opposite to the expected output, exchange the A1 and A2 pins.
